- [ ] Interval milestone also increases level cap?
  - Double?
- [ ] Make pub exponent go down gradually like `y=(10/log(x+1)+6.22)`?
  - This is to make early game more lenient
- [ ] Buff c1?
- [x] Buff c2?
- [ ] Solve the problem of being stuck
  - From Gen:
    > possible solutions:
    > 1. add Refunds (interferes with autobuy, and doesn't work)
    > 2. + term that holds 30%+ power so that a mess up only slows down and can be recovered
    > 3. Figure out why it happens in detail and find a buying mechanism/eq that limits the max stuckness (is that a word?) to a reasonable amount
  - [ ] How about implementing a history of last run's sequence?
    - Do I want to make players recite a manuscript?
  - [x] Unlock freeze sooner? e44 perhaps
  - [ ] Regular variable with cost growth that refills c, and unfreezes?
