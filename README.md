# Collatz Conjecture

A puzzle based on the Collatz conjecture in Exponential Idle.

The Collatz conjecture states that if we take any number, then repeatedly:

- Either divide it by two if it's even,
- or triple it then plus one if it's odd,

then the number will eventually become 1.

What about negative numbers, you ask?
