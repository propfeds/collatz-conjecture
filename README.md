Collatz conjecture puzzle in Exponential Idle.

- Iterates every 1.6 seconds
- Singular upgrade: toggle decrement / increment
- Number starts from 0
- BigInt!
- Puzzle becomes difficult at high numbers?
  - It's easy to let it fall off
  - Freeze number milestone? (warning: same problem with Botched)
  - Freeze number singular upgrade
- Milestone to speed up iteration but dangerous
